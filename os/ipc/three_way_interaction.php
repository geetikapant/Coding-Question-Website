        <u>Question</u><br>
  In three-part(sometimes called three-way or repeat back) communication, the sender(worker) states the messege the receiver(probably another worker) acknowledges the sender and repeats the message in a paraphrased form, and the sender acknowledges the reciver's reply. please do the task for following example and refer the following sample testcases.<br>
  The Chef likes to stay in touch with his staff. So, the Chef, the head server, and the sous-chef all carry two-way transceivers so they can stay in contant contact. Of course,these transceivers have a limited range so if two are too far apart,they cannot communicate directly. the Chef invested in top-of-the-line transceivers which have a few advanced features. One is that even if two people cannot talk directly because they are out of range, if there is another transceivers can still communicate with each other using the third transceiver as an intermediate device. There has been a minor emergeny in the Chef's resturant and he needs to communicate with both the head server and the sous-chef right away. Help the Chef determine if it is possible for all three people to communicate with each other, even if two must communicate through the third because they are too far apart.
